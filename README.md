MPD-Notify
=========

**MPD-Notify** notifies you on MPD's state. It will send a notification on song change and on play/pause/stop; it is not a notification daemon by itself.

To be able to use this, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:
* libnotify
* libmpdclient

To build and install, just run the following commands:

	$ make
	# make clean install
